- Use a render function to render that data (put it on the page)
- Select any existing useful elements from the page
- Define any starting values you can think of for variable data
  - add more as needed
- Render that data to the screen (inside your render method)
- Listen for any events that change our data
  - Make more requests to the server to let it know that the data changed
  - Change the local copy of the data
- Re-Render
