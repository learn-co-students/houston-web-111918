* ~~Create a user that can be authenticated~~
* ~~Create a JWT token for the user~~
* ~~Provide an endpoint to create that token at~~
* ~~Before processing every request, check for authentication~~
* ~~Send the token in the header of every request~~
* ~~Parse the token, so that we can check if the user is who they say they are~~
