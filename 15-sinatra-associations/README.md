Lecture Deliverables:
  As a site visitor, I should be able to see a list of authors

  As a site visitor, I should be able to see a list of books. I should be able to click on each book title to see more information about that book.

  As a site visitor, I should be able to see a form where I create a book. When I create a book I can associate it with an existing author.
```

For each deliverable discuss

1. Does the Schema need to Change?
2. What are the necessary route\(s\)?
