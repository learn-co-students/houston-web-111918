# Object Oriented JavaScript

* Objects
  * Are described by classes
  * Data + Behavior (attributes and methods)
* Todays Outline:
  * Factory Functions
    * Simply functions that return a new object every time you call them
  * Constructor Functions
    * Invoked with the new keyword
    * Uses a prototype to share behavior more performantly
    * Loses context to *this* unless we use an arrow function
  * Class Syntax
    * Uses a constructor method
    * Is not browser compatible 
    * Can be made cross-brower compatible using babel
