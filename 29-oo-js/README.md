# js-character
This is the code we will be working with during our lecture on Object Oriented JavaScript; when convenient, please try to familiarize yourself with it before the lecutre. Open up the index.html in your browser, open the console, and then call `walkEast()` to get started. Check the index.js file and see what other functions you can call, and try to understand how they work. If anything confuses you, please ask questions.
