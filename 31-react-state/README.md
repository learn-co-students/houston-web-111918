# Setup and State

## Pain Points of Mod 3:

* Creating Elements was annoying (extra work, very verbose)
* Knowing when to fetch and render
* Dependency management
* Seperating HTML from logic (identifying variable data)
* Knowing when to attach event listeners

## Adjacent React Technologies

* JSX
  * Syntax for writing HTML in JavaScript 
* Babel
  * Converts pretty code (JSX or class properties, etc...) into the ugly stuff
* Webpack
  * Bundles all of our files together

## Structure of React

* React 
  * A library that works on Native or the Web
* React DOM
  * Web Specific

## State
* Contains the variable data for our component
* Should only be manipulated using `setState`
* Will automatically re-render when changed!
